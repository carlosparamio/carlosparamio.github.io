  position: "Founder & CEO of Skylight, Digital Services Coalition Co-Founder, 18F Co-Founder, Presidential Innovation Fellow — Sarasota, Florida"
  cite: "I've hired a number of Rails developers to work on my social gaming app over the years. As far as I'm concerned, Carlos is one of the Rails Community's top full-stack developers. He possesses a deep understanding of the Rails framework that has enabled our team to build a more flexible, maintainable app (from the front-end to the back-end). He's fully up-to-date on the latest Rails practices and gems, and effectively communicates how these new developments can improve development productivity. I couldn't imagine undertaking another Rails project without Carlos' involvement."

- name: "Matt Williams"
  position: "Software Shepherd — Lithuania"
  cite: "Carlos is a Ruby on Rails guru. There are few that know or keep on top of the internals with such dedication, and he is considered the go-to man when you can't wrap your head around something framework related. Carlos takes great pride in his work, and his code quality and advocacy of DRY principles throughout makes for very happy peers! He continually took on mammoth refactoring tasks which would make most developers cringe, and consistently furthered the quality of the Victor Chandler codebase for the better. I miss not having Carlos around when I get stumped with Rails - a two minute conversation with him often saves an hour or more in research."
